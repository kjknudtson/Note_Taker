  ## Usage

  When the user opens up the application the user will begin by clicking on the "Get Started" button in the middle of the screen.  After this, the user will be taken to the webpage where they can write, record, and delete any notes they take.  They can write in the "Note Title" and "Note Text" areas on the page, and once both are filled, a save button will appear in the upper write of the screen.  When they user has finished their current note, they may click on the save button (shaped like a floppy disk).  Once clicked, the fields will be emptied again, and the note will be saved and the title will be seen to the left of the screen.  The user may click on the note and the fields will be filled with what the user had written down for that note.  If the note is no longer needed, the user may click on the trash can to the right of the saved note.  If clicked, the particular note will be permanently erased.  The pencil shaped button in the top right of the screen may be clicked to begin writing a new note, if the user is currently viewing a previously written note.
